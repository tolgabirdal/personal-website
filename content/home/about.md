Tolga Birdal is an assistant professor in the Department of Computing of Imperial College London. Previously, he was a senior Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Stanford University](stanford.edu) within the [Geometric Computing Group](https://geometry.stanford.edu/) of Prof. Leonidas Guibas. Tolga has defended his masters and Ph.D. theses at the Computer Vision Group, [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures](https://www.in.tum.de/campar/start/), Technical University of Munich led by Prof. Nassir Navab. He was also a Doktorand at Siemens AG under supervision of Dr. Slobodan Ilic working on [Geometric Methods for 3D Reconstruction from Large Point Clouds](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1455362/1455362.pdf). His current foci of interest involve geometric machine learning and 3D computer vision. More theoretical work is aimed at investigating and interrogating limits in geometric computing and non-Euclidean inference as well as principles of deep learning and artificial consciousness. Tolga has several publications at the well-respected venues such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, T-PAMI, ICRA, IROS, ICASSP and 3DV. Aside from his academic life, Tolga is an entrepreneur. He has co-founded multiple companies including [Befunky](https://www.befunky.com), a widely used web-based image editing platform.
